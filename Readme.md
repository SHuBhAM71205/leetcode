# Question that I solved

## Day 1

### Question 1

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## Day 2

### Question 1
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Question 2

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
1 <= numRows <= 1000


## Day 3

### Question 1

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].


### Day 4

# Day 5

## Question 1


The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

The operations are described below:

"../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
"./" : Remain in the same folder.
"x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.

 

Example 1:



Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.
Example 2:



Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]

# Day 6

## Question 1

You are given an integer array nums with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from nums using the following algorithm:

Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.
Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.
Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]
Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].
        - Empty array, so no child.
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].
            - Empty array, so no child.
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.
        - Empty array, so no child.
Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,null,2,null,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

# Day 8

## QUestion 1
You are given an integer array nums.
A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:

(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2.
Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

## Question 1

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

 

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
divisor != 0

## Question 1

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


# DAy 11

## Question 1

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array t


# DAy 12

## Question 1

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "3322251" we replace "33" with "23", replace "222" with "32", replace "5" with "15" and replace "1" with "11". Thus the compressed string becomes "23321511".

Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: "1211"

Explanation:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"
Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: "1"

Explanation:

This is the base case.

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

## Question 1

You are given an array of positive integers nums and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

An array b is called to be a subarray of a if it forms a contiguous subsequence of a, that is, if it is equal to a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r] for some (l,r).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,4,5,6]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5]
Output: 8
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [5,2,1] or [1,2,5].
 

# DAy 15

## Question 1

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20
